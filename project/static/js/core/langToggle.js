          'faq-clt-h10' :"Why do the limited-English conversations seem longer than the English-only conversations?",
          'faq-clt-para10a' :"Our telephone language assistants are required to provide accurate and concise interpretations. They interpret in first person for simplicity and brevity. It is important to remember that they interpret across both languages and cultures, which can make the limited-English conversations longer. You can help facilitate the interpretation by making your message easy for the LEP client to understand. You may need to clarify or elaborate on your message to explain concepts that do not have an equivalent in other languages or cultures.",

        'featured-itpr1-para1a': "It is both a blessing and a burden. It is awesome to be somewhat a role model to your younger family members because you give them hope in achieving their goals. However it is also a burden since you have to figure things out for yourself. You are first one to explore opportunities and find your path. As exciting as that sounds, it can become overwhelming and exhausting. Especially when you don't have a guide. The current misleading stereotype of what is an immigrant completely undermines the true struggle of an immigrant. They know what it is to not have support; they know what it is to not have economic resources; they know what its like to work low paid jobs as long as it brings food to the table. And despite all these limitations, I am witness that these individuals are the first to lend a hand to those that are fighting the same battle. An immigrant strives for the betterment of not only him/herself but also of his/her family, friends and neighbors. In my opinion that is the true definition of what it means to be member of a community. ",

My mother migrated to this country at an early age and was able to pursue higher education despite the cultural and language barriers she faced as she grew up in Oakland. My father migrated as a young adult and unfortunately did not share my mother's luck. He gained his living as a house painter and musician. When I was 11, my family moved to Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. There I was able to reconnect with my roots and solidify my Mexican identity. In 2010 I returned to the US and experienced a drastic culture shock. I found that many of the young adults of my generation did not speak Spanish while those of an older generation spoke fluent Spanish. This was only a small indication of not only a language gap, but also a cultural gap between my Latino community. As I made this realization, I then felt responsible to do my part in lessening this gap by sharing a little bit of my experience of living in Mexico and try to reconnect individuals of different generations.",

My experience later grew when I accompanied my grandmother to her doctor's checkup. It was at this moment that I realized how much information is lost with a language barrier. My grandmother was surprised at what the doctor would say and I saw that having me present allowed my grandmother to express all her doubts and concerns which in turn allowed the doctor to give a through medical analysis. At the end, the doctor said that this was the first time my first grandmother had given so much detail of her symptoms.",

My personal struggles as an immigrant piqued my interest in working with communities similar to the one I grew up in.

Over the years, I got involved with nonprofit, community organizations such as Asian Health Services and Lifelong Medical Care in the San Francisco Bay Area to provide compassionate care to individuals from vulnerable populations and improve community health. The unique volunteering experiences I gained from working with the ethnically and culturally diverse populations of the San Francisco Bay Area played the most influential role in molding my future endeavors.

She taught me to be a confident and strong woman; to fight against traditional, cultural expectations that limit my potential; and to overcome social and economic obstacles with hard work and determination to achieve success. My mother’s sacrifices and strengths were the driving force behind my achievements.

With little English, the immigrant with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), especially the senior, face a lot of challenges when they have to manoeuvre the social service system. Some of us might have experienced this personally when our parents or grandparents got lost, could not fill out lease forms, could not read hospital bills, etc. Join us to change the situation!",

The consecutive interpreter listens (and takes notes if need be) while the speaker talks. When the speaker pauses or finishes speaking, the interpreter reproduces the message in the target language.",

        'featured-itpr1-h1': "What is it like to be the first generation college student in your family?",
        'featured-itpr1-para1a': "It is both a blessing and a burden. It is awesome to be somewhat a role model to your younger family members because you give them hope in achieving their goals. However it is also a burden since you have to figure things out for yourself. You are first one to explore opportunities and find your path. As exciting as that sounds, it can become overwhelming and exhausting. Especially when you don't have a guide. The current misleading stereotype of what is an immigrant completely undermines the true struggle of an immigrant. They know what it is to not have support; they know what it is to not have economic resources; they know what its like to work low paid jobs as long as it brings food to the table. And despite all these limitations, I am witness that these individuals are the first to lend a hand to those that are fighting the same battle. An immigrant strives for the betterment of not only him/herself but also of his/her family, friends and neighbors. In my opinion that is the true definition of what it means to be member of a community. ",

        'featured-itpr1-para2a': "I am a first generation Mexican-American. I come from a very large family who all migrated to this country between the 80's and early 90's. My mother migrated to this country at an early age and was able to pursue higher education despite the cultural and language barriers she faced as she grew up in Oakland. My father migrated as a young adult and unfortunately did not share my mother's luck. He gained his living as a house painter and musician. When I was 11, my family moved to Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. There I was able to reconnect with my roots and solidify my Mexican identity. In 2010 I returned to the US and experienced a drastic culture shock. I found that many of the young adults of my generation did not speak Spanish while those of an older generation spoke fluent Spanish. This was only a small indication of not only a language gap, but also a cultural gap between my Latino community. As I made this realization, I then felt responsible to do my part in lessening this gap by sharing a little bit of my experience of living in Mexico and try to reconnect individuals of different generations.",
